As the name suggests, it's a generator for cat images. Each image is generatod from a variety of image assets in a variety colors, all picked at random... Thus, Random Cat Generator.

#### How to Use:
* Download the zip folder and extract it
* Extract "lib" and "images" in the same folder as the .exe file

Click "Your Cat is..." button to generate a cat. There is only one cat generated per click. Certain cat features like face spots or accessories have added rarity, so they dont appear often.
